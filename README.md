### Internet Wayback Machine
Some of the past content was deleted from BGG. I tried to retrieve those information from the Internet Wayback Machine, but unfortunately the available snapshots were all blank. To avoid similar issues in future, I updated all the snapshots for currently available content page by page. If the need arises again, all the links can be found here:
